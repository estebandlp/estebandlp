### Hi there! Nice to see you here!ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I've been working as a Product Manager and Agile Coach for two years because I love working with people, looking to improve the process with the team, and help create the most incredible products from the Product Manager role. 

âœ¨ But also I really enjoy programming, so, here I am... Introducing myself as a full-stack developer. I worked as a developer for four years, working mostly on the backend using Java and Gosu, but also have experience as a frontend developer working with AngularJS, Angular, and React. (JS, TS, CSS, HTML5)

ðŸŒ± Currently, in my free time, I work as a full-stack developer on Wikn with the stack that I mentioned, which is the team that I co-founded, where we have a client who takes 100% of our time, for now! Because we plan to start writing our story as a Start-Up in the next years.

ðŸ’¬ If you want to know more about me just text me, will be a pleasure to chat!

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on an open-source project, so if you've heard of any, please let me know!

Thanks and have a nice day!
